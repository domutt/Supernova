                          <span>The second edition of SUPERNOVA Outdoor Digital Animation Festival took place September 22nd &amp; 23rd in Denver, Colorado. Supernova is the only major festival to focus solely on the latest advances in digital animation as art by leading artists from around the world, presented free to the public on largescale LED screens in the heart of a prominent metropolitan city. Alongside an all-day education forum, the core of the festival is our competition screening, with signifcant cash awards determined by an international panel of jurors. The 2017 jurors Faiyaz Jafri, Raquel Meyers and Peter Burr awarded Grand Prize to Max Hattler for “Divisional Articulations,” second prize to Jack Wedge for “Tennessee,” and third prize to Nikita Diakur for “Ugly.” Two additional Honorable Mentions were awarded by Festival Director Ivar Zeile to Emily Sasmor for “Strangers Cowboys” and to Seishi Irimajiri for “Borderline.”</span>

              <span class="about-event">Faiyaz Jafri’s work has been exhibited in the form of print, paintings, video installations, animations and life size sculptures all over the world. Jafri’s award winning films have screened at prestigious festivals and museums. He has worked for international advertising clients and magazines, and on corporate and broadcast projects, in charge of motion graphics and post-production in the USA and Hong Kong. In recent years he has given workshops and lectures on his art and theories at universities, conferences, and festivals. He is the founder and curator of the Third Culture Film Festival in Hong Kong and is a part-time lecturer at Parsons School of Design in New York. Denver Digerati screened Jafri’s “Hello Bambi” during the initial Friday Flash back in May of 2013, directly impacting future programming towards an almost exclusive “digital animation” format that is now the core of Supernova. He was later commissioned in 2014 for Denver Digerati’s 10-Second Film Festival and again in 2015 for Friday Flash No.11, resulting in his astounding short “This Ain’t Disneyland” which has since gone on to screen in over 30 film festivals around the world.

                  <span class="event">SUPERNOVA JUROR RAQUEL MEYERS</span>
              </div>
              <span class="about-event">Raquel Meyers is a Spanish artist who defines her practice as KYBDslöjd (drawing by typing). In KYBDslöjd, the screen is the canvas, a rectilinear grid on which one keystroke at a time build a character-by-character imaginary. Like crafting or the typewriter technique. It is brutality itself because it reveals what it is and what it does without adornment. Since 2004 Meyers has performed at festivals like Transmediale, Fylkingen, Piksel, Mapping, La Casa encendida and Cimatics, at 8bit events like Tokyo Blip Festival and the Playlist exhibition, as well at Liste Art Fair Basel, Ars Electronica Center, Alingsås Konsthall, Bonniers Konsthall, Xpo Gallery, Click New Media Arts Festival, Alt_Cph, BEK- Bergen Center for Electronic Arts, LABoral, iMAL, and Square Sounds among others. Meyers’ entry “Vladijenk II (The corroded mainframe at Tartarus edition)” for the inaugural edition of Supernova in 2016 garnered her the festival’s second prize award, delivering a glorious array of pixilated motion that stands as a shining beacon for the historic depths of technologies infiltration into art.

                  <span class="event">SUPERNOVA JUROR PETER BURR</span>
              </div>
              <span class="about-event">Peter Burr (B. 1980) is an artist from Brooklyn, NY, USA specializing in animation and installation. His work has been presented at venues across the world including Le Centre Pompidou, Paris; Reina Sofia National Museum, Madrid; and MoMA PS1, New York. His recent work explores the concept of an endlessly mutating death labyrinth and is being expanded into a video game through the support of Creative Capital and Sundance. Previously, he worked under the alias Hooliganship and in 2006 founded the video label Cartune Xprez, through which he produced live multimedia exhibitions showcasing artists working in experimental animation. Burr has been a major inspiration in the development of Denver Digerati ever since he brought his Cartune Xprez/Hooliganship tour to Denver’s Plus Gallery in 2006. That evening was one of the most joyous and memorable in the history of the gallery, introducing artists prominent in the development of today’s animation as well as a deeply creative and fun multi-media performance component. A prominent view of Burr’s rapidly developing work as an animator was later featured in MonkeyTown IV, a scintillating,  intimate platform intertwining fine dining and contemporary motion-art launched as an extensive community experience in Denver in 2014. Burr’s “The Mess” was awarded Supernova’s prestigious Grand Prize for the inaugural competition in 2016, a 15 minute masterpiece that resonated fully  in the context of a large-scale, outdoor LED presentation.

              </div>
              <span class="about-event">Supernova Founder and Director Ivar Zeile will lead a lively panel discussion with guest artists who have had work selected for official programming screening the next day at the festival. Several of the guests confirmed for the discussion, such as  Pat Wells, Paul Johnson and Caroline Voagen Nelson, have experience as educators in the field of art and animation as well as practioners in the medium. Others, such as Zihrong Lu and Seishi Irimajiri are emerging artists pushing towards developing careers, and also traveling to Denver from far outside the US. The informal discussion will cover numerous angles relating to working with digital techniques as well as the changing nature of practice and exhibition in the world at large today. Additional guest artists expected, to date, include Peter Whittenberger and Atomic Elroy.</span>
